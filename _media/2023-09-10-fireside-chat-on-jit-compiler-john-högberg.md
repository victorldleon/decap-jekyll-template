excerpt: >-
  "Good things come to those who wait" goes the saying, and indeed, after 10
  years and several interesting attempts and research, Erlang 24.0 finally comes
  out of the box with a JIT (i.e. Just-In-Time) compiler that is impressive both
  in its performance, as well as its simplicity, and has gotten the entire BEAM
  community talking about it!


  In this fireside chat, hosted by Stavros Aronis, Lukas Larsson and John Högberg will answer all your questions about the new JIT.
